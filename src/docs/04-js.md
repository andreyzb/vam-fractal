## Browsers...

We're aiming to have function Javascript working down to Internet Explorer 9. We use services and tools like Modernizr and Polyfill.io to enable this to happen.

## Including on a site

Obviously you need to include the core `vamscript.js` file. However don't forget to also include polyfill.io, and conditionally include Modernizr and Respond.js. Eg:

```
<!--[if lte IE 8]>
  <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/respond.js/1.4.2/respond.min.js"></script>
<![endif]-->
```

Have a look at `components/_partials/_preview.html` within Fractal as an example.

## Linting

Javascript is linted via  ESLint using a modified version of the Airbnb ruleset. Before writing or modifying Javascript in this project it is advised that you read through the documentation around the rules
